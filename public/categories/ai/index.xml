      <description>What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My previous post using API with Powershell got me thinking about opening the idea to go beyond PowerShell. I am very open with people around my lack of skill with Azure CLI, I do however want to learn some new things.
We also have this great technology called GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, so I figured let me dig into &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; as I am a techy at heart and let me improve my skills with Azure CLI.</description>
