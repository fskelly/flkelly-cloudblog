      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-doing&#34;&gt;What are we doing?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I spend more time with my customers and my teams within my organization, I am learning that there a lot of aspects of Azure VMware Solution that we take for granted and simply skim over as we assume (badly) that everyone knows exactly how to &amp;ldquo;the basics&amp;rdquo;. With this series of &amp;ldquo;How Do I&amp;rdquo; posts, I am going to try and address some of the more common questions that I get asked and hopefully provide some useful information to help you on your Azure VMware Solution journey. I will endeavour to copy as many topics as I can and I am always open to ideas and suggestions. You can reach out to me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/fskelly&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or post a suggestion for the log on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fskelly/flkelly-cloudblog/issues&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; - please remember these are designed to be short and sweet and not full blown tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
