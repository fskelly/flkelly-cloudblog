      <description>What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My previous post using API with Powershell got me thinking about opening the idea to go beyond PowerShell. I am very open with people around my lack of skill with Azure CLI, I do however want to learn some new things.
We also have this great technology called GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, so I figured let me dig into &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; as I am a techy at heart and let me improve my skills with Azure CLI.</description>

      <description>What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My first dive into cost management was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. Bu this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API&amp;rsquo;s, this is likely to change.</description>

      <description>Absolute basics with Azure and PostMan Getting started Many of the articles I have found online with regards to the Azure REST API assume a fair level of familiarity with Azure which can be a good and bad thing. You see the Azure Portal makes interacting with the Azure REST API very easy as a lot of the &amp;ldquo;prerequisite&amp;rdquo; work is done in the portal as part of the process. For this blog post we will work on something quite basic, &amp;ldquo;Create a Virtual Machine&amp;rdquo;.</description>
