      <description>What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My previous post using API with Powershell got me thinking about opening the idea to go beyond PowerShell. I am very open with people around my lack of skill with Azure CLI, I do however want to learn some new things.
We also have this great technology called GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, so I figured let me dig into &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; as I am a techy at heart and let me improve my skills with Azure CLI.</description>

      <description>What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My first dive into cost management was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. Bu this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API&amp;rsquo;s, this is likely to change.</description>
